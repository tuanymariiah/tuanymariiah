Hey, how's it going? Pleasure, my name is Tuany

Glad you found me, I'll introduce myself a little, ok?
I have a degree in systems analysis and development from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - Campus Maca√≠ba (UFRN/EAJ) and from an early age I started to be fascinated by the data area and all the time I had free, I dedicated myself a lot. Today I'm finishing my academic master's degree also at UFRN in the field of computational intelligence and graphic processing research.

Here on GitHub, I post a lot about: machine Learning, web scraping, python, data analysis and data visualization, always looking to collaborate with other fellow data scientists and developers who love the field.

I also created an Instagram to show that I can share knowledge about the world of programming, technology, data science. I invite you to meet me on LinkedIn and the medium.

I'll leave everything linked down here
