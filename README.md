Hey, how's it going? Pleasure, my name is Tuany 👋 🤝

Glad you found me, I'll introduce myself a little, ok?
I have a degree in systems analysis and development from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte - Campus Macaíba (UFRN/EAJ) and from an early age I started to be fascinated by the data area and all the time I had free, I dedicated myself a lot. Today I'm finishing my academic master's degree also at UFRN in the field of computational intelligence and graphic processing research. 👩‍💻 📚 🔎

Here on GitHub, I post a lot about: machine Learning, web scraping, python, data analysis and data visualization, always looking to collaborate with other fellow data scientists and developers who love the field. 🎲🎲🎲

I also created an Instagram to show that I can share knowledge about the world of programming, technology, data science. I invite you to meet me on LinkedIn and the medium.

I'll leave everything linked down here

Now, I wanted to show you my personal projects and what I've been studying


## Projects
---

1. [Analyzing data from 120 years of olympiads 🥇 🥈 🥉](https://github.com/tuanymariiah/data_analysis/blob/main/analisando_dados_de_120_anos_de_olimpiadas.ipynb)

In this project I used a database available on Kaggle and decided to extract some information about the summer olympics, detail, this database does not contain data from the olympics that took place in Tokyo.

2. [Beer consumption in the city of São Paulo 🍻 🍺](https://github.com/tuanymariiah/data_analysis/blob/main/Consumo_de_cerveja.ipynb)

The data collected to carry out this project were taken from Kaggle. In this project, in addition to the data analysis performed, I decided to predict the price of beer in the city of São Paulo using linear regression.

4. [House Rocket 🏡 🏘 🏠](https://github.com/tuanymariiah/kcHouse)

Project that aims to use data from home sales to generate insights and help the business team in decision making. The project has an exploratory data analysis that seeks to answer the proposed business questions, and brings the results in a web app built with Streamlit.
